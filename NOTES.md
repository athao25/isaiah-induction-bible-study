# Working Notes

## User preferences (from initial interview, 2026-07-17)
- Mission: personal depth, not teaching prep or apologetics mastery
- New to serious study: teach method foundations, define terms, no assumed vocabulary. Glossary adherence matters.
- 20-30 min daily. Keep lessons small: one passage unit, one win.
- ESV quotations throughout. Owned: MacArthur Study Bible + Olive Tree.
- Theological frame: Reformed. Postmil (Durbin) is the home lens for kingdom passages; flag MacArthur (premil) and White (amil) alternatives honestly at Isa 2, 11, 24-27, 60, 65-66.
- Workflow: user reads passage in ESV FIRST, jots observations, then opens lesson. Lessons should open by asking what they observed, then check.
- Retention: memory verses (~15, one per section, listed in reference/memory-verses.html) + spaced recall quiz at the top of each lesson.
- Community prompts: yes, tied to church life.
- User asked for "complete entire lessons": build each lesson fully (no stubs). Course generated in batches as the learner progresses (zone of proximal development requires seeing learning records first); curriculum map in reference/isaiah-book-map.html covers all 66 chapters up front.
- No em dashes in any written content (user global rule).

## Course conventions
- Lesson files: lessons/NNNN-slug.html, numbered sequentially.
- Every lesson links assets/course.css and assets/quiz.js, opens with a recall quiz, ends with: application, memory verse work (when active), primary source recommendation, "ask your teacher" reminder, and links to reference docs.
- Quiz answer options: keep all options the same word count so formatting gives no clue.
- Reference docs are the durable artifacts; lessons point into them.
- reference/macarthur-notes.html = user's personal copy of their owned MacArthur Study Bible Isaiah notes (pasted by user 2026-07-17), per-chapter anchors ch01-ch66. PRIVATE USE ONLY: never publish as an Artifact or share; it is copyrighted material the user owns. Lessons may deep-link (#chNN) and should engage its premil readings critically per the course's postmil home lens (caveat card is in the file header). Quoted text kept verbatim, including its own punctuation.
- Shared left sidebar: assets/nav.js (manifest-driven) + styles in course.css. EVERY page includes `<script src="../assets/nav.js" defer></script>` after the course.css link. When adding a lesson: add one entry to the LESSONS array in nav.js, nothing else. Mark-complete progress persists in localStorage key `isaiah-study-progress` (per browser).
